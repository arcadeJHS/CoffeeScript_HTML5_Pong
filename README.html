<p>Project start up. A lot of work needed.</p>
<p>The following points need research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: paddles, ball, points, and net should be &quot;linear scanner&quot;, as an old TV.</li>
<li>About court, net, points, and paddle size... proportions... placement and distance from the edge.</li>
<li>When ball appears on screen: random location?</li>
<li>Ball bhaviour: similar to original as much as possible.</li>
<li>Sounds?</li>
<li>Gameplay/advancement/levels???</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pong</h1>
<p>A HTML5 porting of the classic arcade Pong, written in CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>Demo: <a href="http://arcadejhs.github.io/CoffeeScript_HTML5_Pong/">http://arcadejhs.github.io/CoffeeScript_HTML5_Pong/</a></p>
<p>Project start up. A lot of work needed.</p>
<p>The following points need research:
1. Shape: paddles, ball, points, and net should be &quot;linear scanner&quot;, as an old TV.
2. About court, net, points, and paddle size... proportions... placement and distance from the edge.
3. When ball appears on screen: random location?
4. Ball bhaviour: similar to original as much as possible.
5. Sounds?
6. Gameplay/advancement/levels???</p>

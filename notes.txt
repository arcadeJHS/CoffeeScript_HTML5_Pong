== NOTES ==
1. Shape: paddles, ball, points, and net should be "linear scanner", as an old TV.
2. About court, net, points, and paddle size... proportions... placement and distance from the edge.
3. When ball appears on screen: random location?
4. Ball bhaviour: similar to original as much as possible.
5. Sounds?
6. Gameplay/advancement/levels???

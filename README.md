Pong
==============
A HTML5 porting of the classic arcade Pong, written in CoffeeScript.

Demo: http://arcadejhs.github.io/CoffeeScript_HTML5_Pong/

Project start up. A lot of work needed.

The following points need research:

- Shape: paddles, ball, points, and net should be "linear scanner", as an old TV (cathode ray tube effect).
- About court, net, points, and paddle size... proportions... placement and distance from the edge.
- When ball appears on screen: random location?
- Ball behaviour: similar to original as much as possible. New ball on random position.
- Sounds?
- Gameplay/advancement/levels???
